# Aaron's Aurora Lily58's Keymap

## Todo

- fw
  - encoder -> decide/add functionality (ideas in notebook)
  - oled -> decide/add functionality
    - would be cool to show symbols/layout on the relevant side ?
  - leds -> decide/add functionali  ty
  - in general, peruse the relevant QMK drivers / git `.md`'s for cool stuff to add
- hw
  - oled cover
  - encoder knobs that fit
  - solder up new mcus

## Notes

- This directory started as a copy of the `keymaps/default` directory.
- The `keymap.json` file was edited to reflect the initial layout I wanted.
- The `keymap.json` file was converted to a `.c` file, open "QMK MSYS", then:

```sh
cd /d/qmk_firmware/keyboards/splitkb/aurora/lily58/keymaps/aaron/
qmk json2c -o keymap.c keymap.json

# If a JSON file is present, the C file is ignored, so rename the JSON file
mv keymap.json keymap.json.archive
```
